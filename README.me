# Blobbington Simulation

**Simulates evolving autonomous agents ("blobs") and their interactions in a virtual society.**

---

## 🧠 What is this project?

This is the backend and client-side of a simulation inspired by the **Primer** YouTube channel. It explores how autonomous agents ("blobs") behave, interact, and evolve over time in a virtual world called **Blobbington**.

As a hobbyist, self-taught, and AI-supported developer, my goal is to build a flexible simulation framework that models emergent behavior and societal change.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Simulation Core**:
  - Implement `Blob()` agents in a `World()` environment
  - Define a `SimEngine` that governs movement, interaction, and evolution
  - Assign traits and properties to blobs
  - Simulate interactions based on conditions
  - Track population changes across generations

- **Data & Communication**:
  - Design a clean data structure for communication with renderers
  - Enable networking between simulation and visualization layer

- **Visualization**:
  - Start with a simple renderer (e.g. [Ursina](httpsplore browser-based JS rendering
  - Eventually experiment with game engines like Godot

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack (planned)

- Python, NumPy
- Optional: Pandas, SciPy
- Visualization: Ursina → JS → Godot
- Networking: TBD (e.g. sockets, REST API)

## 📺 Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by the simulation concepts and visual storytelling from the Primer YouTube channel.
